A repository for my CA2 Java Script Game Engine Project.

In my game you play as a little ghost who has to go around collecting other ghosts. 
With each ghost you collect you are able to do another jump.
As your character is upgraded with more jumps the platforming gets more challenging.
To beat the game collect all 7 ghosts in the level.
